      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Mohammad Modassir Hussain</strong>, a first-year Computer Science student at Delhi Technological University (DTU). I have a strong passion for technology and learning to create useful digital experiences. Currently, I’m focusing on web development and programming fundamentals as I build my skills.</p>

      <p>I completed my schooling at the International Indian School in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, and joined DTU in 2025 for my B.Tech degree. My interests include web development, game development, and problem-solving, and I enjoy combining creativity with technical skills as I learn. Academically, I performed well in my CBSE board exams, scoring over 90% in both 10th and 12th grades.</p>

      <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy playing badminton and video games, and I love watching movies and anime. These hobbies help me relax and spark my creativity outside of my studies.</p>
